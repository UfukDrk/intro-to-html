          Hi! My name is Ufuk Doruk, and I'm currently a student learning the
          elements of web development and design. I've always been relating to
          how websites are built and how creativity meets technology in the
          digital space. My goal is to one day, I will learn the tricks of my
          courses such as web develop and design and use them in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy hanging out, exploring , listening to music
          and chilling. I'm also a curious person who loves learning new skills
          which are editing videos or understanding how coding works behind the
          scenes. I believe that staying curious and open-minded is the key to
          personal growth.
